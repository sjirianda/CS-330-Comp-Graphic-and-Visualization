## How do I approach designing software?
I like to create an initial idea, usually in the form of an algorithm or requirements, and then work to prove or disprove it through testing and refinement.

## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Through this project, I gained firsthand experience with OpenGL. I learned how to apply movement, lighting, and texturing to a scene. Building directly with OpenGL was challenging but rewarding.

## What design process did you follow for your project work?
I worked to closely replicate the real-world scene from my photographs while also meeting the assignment requirements. For example, even though my actual scene had uniform lighting, I added a colored lamp to satisfy project guidelines.

## How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Breaking large projects into small milestones and focusing on building and testing one piece at a time is a strategy I can apply to any future development work. It improves clarity, organization, and reduces errors early in the process.

## How do I approach developing programs?
I take an incremental and hypothesis-driven approach to programming. I design small components, test their functionality, refine them, and then integrate them into larger systems.

## What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
The most valuable strategy I learned was iterative development. Instead of trying to complete everything at once, I broke tasks into small milestones and tackled them step-by-step. Creating small proof-of-concept versions made testing and debugging much easier.

## How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was essential. I built simplified versions of features first — like basic lighting or simple textures — then expanded them after confirming the small parts worked. This approach made debugging much more manageable and helped ensure overall success.

## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
My coding approach became much more structured and incremental over time. Instead of rushing toward a final build, I focused on achieving small, verifiable goals and adjusting as needed based on what I learned along the way.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science helps me by giving me a deeper understanding of what developers experience daily. As I aim to become a better project manager, this technical background allows me to communicate more effectively and manage projects more intelligently.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Studying computational graphics sharpened my technical skills and gave me confidence to engage in higher-level discussions about visualization technologies, which will be useful as I continue pursuing technical coursework.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Having a background in computational graphics allows me to better contribute to technical conversations. This experience positions me to bridge gaps between technical and project management teams in my professional career.
